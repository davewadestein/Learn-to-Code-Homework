# Learn-to-Code-Homework

1. Modify our guessing game program so that it keeps track of all the guesses the user guessed. Keep those guesses in a list so that you can show the user their guesses at the end. Attached is a screenshot of how I think it should work. Be sure to write down the steps before writing any code! 
Here is the intended output:

<pre>
Enter your guess: 50
Too high!
Enter your guess: 25
Too high!
Enter your guess: 12
Too high!
Enter your guess: 6
Too high!
Enter your guess: 3
Too low!
Enter your guess: 4
Too low!
Enter your guess: 5
You got it in 7 guesses!
Here are your guesses: [50, 25, 12, 6, 3, 4, 5]
