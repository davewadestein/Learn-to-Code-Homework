# Learn-to-Code-Homework

0. In general, try to modify _any_ code you've written to add new features until you just can't add anything else.

1. Start with the guessing game. If it doesn't have a way for the user to quit the game, add that. (Perhaps entering a guess of 0 means the user is done playing.)
2. Tell the player if they are "close" when they make their guess.
3. Keep track of all the guesses the user guessed. Keep the guesses in a list so that you can show the user their guesses at the end. Attached is a screenshot of how I think it should work. Be sure to write down the steps before writing any code! 
Here is the intended output:

<pre>
Enter your guess: 50
Too high!
Enter your guess: 25
Too high!
Enter your guess: 12
Too high!
Enter your guess: 6
Too high!
Enter your guess: 3
Too low!
Enter your guess: 4
Too low!
Enter your guess: 5
You got it in 7 guesses!
Here are your guesses: [50, 25, 12, 6, 3, 4, 5]
